## Directory structure

## `./infra`

This contains the infrastructure code for the project.
It contains [multiple environments](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/style#multiple-environments), each with its own directory.

The `modules` directory contains reusable modules that are used across the diffrent environments.
